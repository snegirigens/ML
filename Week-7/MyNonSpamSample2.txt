Dear Ms. Perstina, Dear Mr. Snegirev,

 regarding your apartment in Olbersstrasse in Berlin, we have some information for you.

 The tenant moved out. Both of his legs are to be amputated and after the operation , he will move in a supervised residence.

 Attached you can find photos of your apartment. As you can see, the apartment has to be renovated before another tenant can move in.

 After the apartment has been renovated, we are looking for a new tenant. For that we take an one-time additional fee of one net cold rent, as stated in our contract.

 Have a nice day and kind regards from Berlin,

 Daniela Walter
